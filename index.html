    <p class="body-text">Welcome! This webpage will help you learn about the three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. We will look at how the molecules in these three states behave and how their behaviour differs from the other states.
    <!--br tags are break lines, meaning they force a new line, which helps with things like adding spaces in between text while using the same paragraph tag.-->
    <br>
    <br>
    Along the way, you will be able to see the differences for yourself with three interactive animations.

    <p class="body-text">A solid is quite possibly the simplest state of matter. The molecules in a solid are tightly compacted together, usually in some defined order or pattern. They form rigid objects that have a volume and shape that does not change as the molecules stay in their place, giving the object its solid shape and un-changeable volume. Of course, the molecules aren't completely frozen. They just don't move around enough to change anything about them like shape, volume, or rigidness. They sort of vibrate in one place. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Solid molecules are quite boring. They barely move at all! Take a look at this diagram below to see how the molecules move in a solid object.

    <h2 class="sub-titles">Liquid</h2>
    <div class="body-style">
    <p class="body-text">
    Liquids are essentially melted solids. When a solid melts, it becomes a liquid. For example, ice, a solid, becomes water, a liquid, when it is melted. The molecules in a liquid are spaced out enough so that they can move around and can go over and under each other. They also move around faster than the slight vibration of solid molecules. Liquids have no definite shape but still have a definite volume. This allows liquids to be poured into different containers. In fact, liquids will take the shape of whatever container they have been poured into, even though their volume remains the same.
    <br>
    <br>
    Liquid molecules are a bit more interesting than solids. They move around more which gives them the ability to flow. They are also more spaced out than solids. Take a look at this diagram below to see how liquid molecules move.

    <h2 class="sub-titles">Gas</h2>
    <div class="body-style">
    <p class="body-text">
    Gas molecules, unlike solids or liquids, have neither a definite shape nor definite volume. This means that they are free-spirited and do not take the shape of any container. Gas molecules move much faster than solid or liquid molecules and are far more spaced out, allowing them to swirl and float around.
    <br>
    <br>
    Gas molecules are great fun! They move around so quickly and they are spaced out so that they can swirl and flow over each other in beautiful motions. They are also much more spaced out than liquid molecules. Take a look at this diagram below to see how gas molecules move around.
